## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Flow
```
Browser (React 18)
    ↓ HTTPS/TLS 1.3
Next.js 14 App Router (Node.js)
    ├── UI Routes (SSR) → [locale]/*
    ├── API Routes (REST) → /api/*
    └── Middleware (Auth + i18n)
    ↓
PostgreSQL 15+ (Prisma ORM)
    ├── Organization (multi-tenant)
    ├── Users + RBAC roles
    ├── AISystem inventory
    ├── Framework + Controls
    ├── Assessment + Risks
    └── Evidence + AuditLog
```

### Database Entities (20+ Core Models)

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* response body */ },
  "message": "Operation successful"
}
```

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Calculation Formula
```
Inherent Risk = Likelihood (1-5) × Impact (1-5) = 1-25
Residual Risk = Inherent Risk × (1 - ControlEffectiveness/100)
```

### Risk Levels
| Level | Score | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Low | 1-4 | Accept or monitor |
| Medium | 5-9 | Mitigate within 90 days |
| High | 10-16 | Mitigate within 30 days |
| Critical | 17-25 | Immediate action required |
